# Scp049rework
A Synapse 2 plug-in that adds a lot of new feature to SCP-049.

***

## Description
**This plug-in has a lot of configs, make sure to take a look.**
*There is currently no available way to detect a natural revive, therefore some configs are temporarely hidden until this is fixed in the next Synapse update probably.*
With this plug-in you can :
- [x] Change the speed of SCP-049.
- [x] Change his health and max health.
- [x] Customize his regeneration which work on him and his instances as well.
- [x] Customize how much health he gains after a kill and/or a revive.
- [x] Make SCP-049-2 explode on death.
- [x] Add translations.

And more...

Additionally this plug-in brings 2 new commands :
| Command | Aliases | Function |
| :-------------: | :------------: | :------ |
| .LateRevive | .LateCure .ReanimationTardive | Revives a nearby corpse that you normally wouldn't be able to revive after a configurable amount of kills and/or revives. |
| .UpgradeInstance | .UInstance .AmeliorerInstance | Upgrades the SCP-04-2 you're looking at which adds him configurable health/max health as well as giving him a configurable SCP-207 effect after a configurable amount of kills and/or revives. |
